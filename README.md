# Design Philosophy

This document describes Go design philosophies I personally try to use/start with when working, building, or writing in Go.

## General

1. Prefer easy to understand over easy to do
2. First do it, then do it right, then do it better, then make it testable [14]
3. When you spawn goroutines, make it clear when - or whether - they exit. [2]
4. Packages that are imported only for their side effects should be avoided [4]
5. Package level and global variables should be avoided
6. magic is bad; global state is magic â†’ no package level vars; no func init [13]

## Dependencies

1. External dependencies should fail fast or allow for reconciliation
    - external connections, port binding, environment variables, secrets, etc
    - Fail fast
        - Don't wait for traffic before binding to ports or testing external connections
    - Allow for reconciliation
        - should block traffic or calls until things are healthy
        - should be accompanied by some way to check health
2. Make all dependencies explicit [11]

## Naming

1. Naming general rules [12]
    - Structs are plain nouns: API, Replica, Object
    - Interfaces are active nouns: Reader, Writer, JobProcessor
    - Functions and methods are verbs: Read, Process, Sync
2. Package names [15]
    - Short: no more than one word
    - No plural
    - Lower case
    - Informative about the service it gives
    - Avoid utilities/models packages
3. Avoid renaming imports except to avoid a name collision; good package names should not require renaming [3]

## Interfaces

1. Accept interfaces, return structs [5]
2. Small interfaces are better [6]
3. Define an interface when you actually need it, not when you foresee needing it [7]
4. Interfaces [15]
    - Use interfaces as function/method arguments & as field types
    - Small interfaces are better

## Functions/Methods

1. All top-level, exported names should have doc comments, as should non-trivial unexported type or function declarations. [1]
2. Methods/functions [15]
    - One function has one goal
    - Simple names
    - Reduce the number of nesting levels
3. Only func main has the right to decide which flags, env variables, config files are available to the user [10]
4. `context.Context` should, in most cases, be the first argument of all functions or methods
5. Prefer synchronous functions - functions which return their results directly or finish any callbacks or channel ops before returning - over asynchronous ones. [8]

## Errors

1. Error Handling [15]
    - `main` should normally be the only one calling fatal errors or `os.Exit`

## Source files

1. One file should be named like the package [9]
2. One file = One responsibility [9]
3. if you only have one command prefer a top level `main.go`, if you have more than one command put them in `cmd/`
